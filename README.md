# Send current Spotify track to Spotify

This is a heavily modified script that was built on the original script by https://github.com/beaksandclaws. This is designed to simply take the current track and send it to spotify. To configure it you will need a slack incoming webhook URL. (https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
